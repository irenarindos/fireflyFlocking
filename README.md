Firefly Flocking System
===============
Video at: https://vimeo.com/30526882

Flock movement is dictated with rules for collision avoidance, flock centering, velocity matching. I used a Runge-Kutta integration method.

The user can navigate the 3D space using a mouse while the flocking sim is running.
